function matrix_divided:
divides all elements of a given matrix by a given divisor(div)
    Args:
        matrix(list of lists): 2-D list of lists of integers/floats
	    div: the divisor
	Return:
        list of lists: a new matrix, same size as matrix containing
		the results of division of all elements of matrix by div
